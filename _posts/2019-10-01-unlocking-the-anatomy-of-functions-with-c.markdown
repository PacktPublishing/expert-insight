C is a _procedural_ programming language. In C, functions act as procedures, and they are building blocks of a C program. So, it is important to know what they are, how they behave, and what happens when you enter or leave a function. In general, functions (or procedures) are analogous to ordinary variables that store algorithms instead of values. By putting variables and functions together into a new type, we can store relevant values and algorithms under the same concept. In this article, we will explore functions and discuss their properties in C.
_This article is an excerpt from the book Extreme C by Kamran Amini. Kamran teaches you to use Câ€™s power. Building on your existing C knowledge, you will master preprocessor directives, macros, conditional compilation, pointers, and much more. You will gain new insight into algorithm design, functions, and structures. Discover how C helps you squeeze maximum performance in critical, resource-constrained applications._
